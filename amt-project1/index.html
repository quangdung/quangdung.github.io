<p>Authors : Nguyen-Phuong Le, Quang-Dung Ngo</p>
<p>This project has been created for the AMT course of the HEIG-VD, under the supervision of Mr. Olivier Liechti.
Itâ€™s purpose is to create an API which will manage differents sensors (which could, for example, measure the temperature of a room or detect the variations taking place in a particular area), and in turn, manage the observations captured on these sensors and turn them into facts which summarize the amount of informations given by those observations. </p>
<p>The project is using JPA and a REST architecture to achieve its goals and will ultimately allow the following functionnalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create, Read, Update and Delete organizations, sensors, users and observations</li>
<li>Display the different entries from the database in a convenient manner.</li>
<li>Allow for different users to use the API and store their informations and tie them to an organization, in order to sort them more easily</li>
</ul>
<p>The database is composed of :</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizations, defined by their id number and their names</li>
<li>Sensors, defined by their id number, name, description, type, visibility and the organization to which they are tied to.</li>
<li>Users, defined by their id number, first name, last name, email, password, the organization to which they are tied to and if they are the main contact of that organization</li>
<li>Observations, defined by their id number, name, value, creation date and the sensor to which they are tied to.</li>
<li>Facts, which come in two forms:<ul>
<li>Facts tied to a particular sensor</li>
<li>Facts tied to a particular sensor, as well as a particular date</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
